## Agenda

We kicked off the collab space üéâ

Some topics we want to explore in future meetings and offline:

- [LFX Crowdfunding](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/crowdfunding/) gap analysis
- Some JS ecosystem projects could benefit from a guide on how to spend resources once funded.
- Can OpenJS become a fiscal host in Open Collective? This could reduce fees from other fiscal hosts.
- Identify projects and their current financial situation within OpenJS.
- Invite projects to share their experiences with us.
- List platforms and ways to get sponsored as a ‚Äúmaintainers group‚Äù or ‚Äúsolo maintainer.‚Äù Many challenges are associated with each platform. Sharing our experience could benefit the ecosystem.
- Change meeting frequency to bi-weekly (@rginn).
- Create a Slack channel (@rginn).
- Create a blog post to announce the collab space in about a month (@rginn/@UlisesGascon).
- Create an automation to generate the issue meetings, also the agenda labels (@rginn/@UlisesGascon)
- As a group, provide feedback on [Collective Funds Guidelines](https://github.com/collective-funds/guidelines/blob/main/GUIDELINES.md). Explore if we want to recommend them to our projects?
