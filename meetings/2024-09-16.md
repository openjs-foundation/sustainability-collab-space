  - Discussion on how the sessions will be structured.
  - Maybe we can start with Express and Mocha.
  - ESLint and WebDriver are great projects to invite if they want to participate.
  - @Wess: Another option is to organize a ‚Äúdedicated‚Äù event with some ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù around and let every project talk about their initiatives for 10-15m in a streaming format with a good MC/entertainer.
    - It is hard to coordinate so many projects at the same time/space.
    -  Bring sponsors to motivate maintainers to show up and share their experiences.
