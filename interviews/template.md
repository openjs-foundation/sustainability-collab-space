# üå± Sustainability Collaboration Space: Sponsorship & Funding Insights  

## Introduction  
As part of the **Sustainability Collaboration Space**, we aim to ensure long-term sustainability and support the growth of OpenJS projects. To help projects navigate the challenges of securing sponsorship and financial support, we are gathering insights from those who have successfully obtained funding or are in the process of doing so.  

Below is a list of questions designed to extract useful knowledge from these projects. The goal is to learn from their experiences and identify best practices that can benefit other OpenJS projects.
